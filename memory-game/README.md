## Summary
Each square has a number beneath it. Click a square to reveal a number and try to find its match somewhere else on the board. If you guess incorrectly, the numbers will be covered again. If you match two numbers, they will become green and lock on the board. Find every match to complete the board. Manually adjust the size/difficulty of the game board using the input box above the game board.
